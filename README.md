This project is part of my journey to learn **Cloud Engineering and DevOps** concepts.  

## Features  
- REST endpoints to create and retrieve insurance quotes  
- Built with **Java + Spring Boot**  
- Packaged as a JAR and containerized with Docker  
- Deployed on a Kubernetes cluster using `Deployment` and `Service` manifests
