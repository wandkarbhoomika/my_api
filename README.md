# my_api
_A Spring Boot microservice containerized with Docker and deployed on Kubernetes_  

## Overview  
The **Insurance Quote API** is a RESTful microservice that provides insurance quotes for different products. It demonstrates how to:  
- Build and package a Spring Boot application  
- Containerize it using Docker  
- Deploy it on Kubernetes for scalability and portability  

This project is part of my journey to learn **Cloud Engineering and DevOps** concepts.  

## Features  
- REST endpoints to create and retrieve insurance quotes  
- Built with **Java + Spring Boot**  
- Packaged as a JAR and containerized with Docker  
- Deployed on a Kubernetes cluster using `Deployment` and `Service` manifests  

## Tech Stack  
- **Language:** Java 17  
- **Framework:** Spring Boot  
- **Containerization:** Docker  
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes
